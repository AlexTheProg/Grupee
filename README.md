Grupee: The social music app

Grupee is a music app designed with the social aspect in mind. Users are going to be able to share what songs they enjoyed the most, what their favorite genre is, and, of course,
the will have the option to comment on posts and express their love for what their peers have shared. 

The project is in its very early infancy, being developed as a license project, but I wish to keep working on it until the image and standards that I have set for myself 
and this project are met and people can start using the platform and hopefully, enjoy it. 

This is an open-source project so feel free to contribute in your own way.

The app uses **Firebase Firestore** and **Firebase Storage** as the main database and storage software.
